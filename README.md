## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes **144K+ delivery records** to uncover:  
- **Delay trends** across routes, destinations, and days  
- **On-time vs delayed deliveries** and contributing factors  
- **Impact of route type, source centers, and trip duration**  
- **Interactive dashboards** for real-time decision-making

## 📊 Key Insights  
✅ Only **10.3% of deliveries** were on time → **89.7% delayed**  
✅ **Full Truck Load (FTL)** routes had higher delays & variation  
✅ **Haryana** reported the **longest delivery duration (164K hrs)**, Tamil Nadu the shortest (20.7K hrs)  
✅ **Source IND000000ACB** contributed **13.6% of total delays**  
✅ **Weekday deliveries** dominated (73.7%) compared to weekends (26.3%)
